## Milestone 5, Task 2

## Goal
This repository was made for a course of the study Information Science in Groningen. It is used to share the code for assessment.

## Code
When the first pipe is run in isolation, the output is all text on the original wikipedia page.
When the first two pipes are run in isolation, the output is 282 alternating lines of 'de' and 'De'.

## Data
In the code, a url for the wikipedia page on the Rijksuniversiteit Groningen is used. When the code is run, it downloads only the text on that page.
